# Per-application settings sections follow, marked as [App=app_name_pattern],
# where app_name_pattern is Java RegEx pattern (or simple app name).
# TODO: check how patterns are compatible with /

# Supported are: native application names (like 'tomcat7') and web application
# names running in supported servlet containers (started with '/', e.g. '/MyWebUI').
# TODO: currently only web app names are supported. Also consider support of 'jar:myapp.jar'

# As the application name may match several patterns, the settings override 
# each other, and the latest matching setting wins.
